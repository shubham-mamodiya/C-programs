 *
 * A guide to writing clean, smart, and elegant code.
 * No examples included — only principles and approach.
 */


    /* 1. Understand the problem first
     * --------------------------------
     * - Clarify input and output.
     * - Write the logic in plain language before coding.
     * - If you can't explain it simply, code will be messy.
     */

    /* 2. First goal: make it work (brute force)
     * -----------------------------------------
     * - Write a straightforward working solution.
     * - Don't chase elegance before correctness.
     * - Optimize only after the code is correct.
     */

    /* 3. Look for patterns
     * --------------------
     * - Notice repeated behavior or conditions.
     * - Convert repetitive code into loops or functions.
     * - Replace multiple if/else blocks with structured logic.
     * - Use tables/arrays/maps when logic repeats in directions/cases.
     */

    /* 4. Reduce complexity
     * ---------------------
     * - Keep functions small and focused.
     * - Flatten nested conditions where possible.
     * - Return early to avoid deep nesting.
     * - Fewer branches = easier to reason about.
     */

    /* 5. Choose meaningful names
     * ---------------------------
     * - Variables and functions should convey intent.
     * - Avoid single-letter names except for trivial loops.
     * - Readability is part of elegance.
     */

    /* 6. Refactor after code works
     * -----------------------------
     * - Remove redundancy.
     * - Generalize repeated logic.
     * - Extract reusable chunks into functions.
     * - Make the second version cleaner than the first.
     */

    /* 7. Learn by reading good code
     * ------------------------------
     * - Study open source projects.
     * - Observe elegant patterns used by others.
     * - Learn idioms, styles, and structure from real codebases.
     */

    /* 8. Practice rewriting solutions
     * -------------------------------
     * - Take working code and refine it.
     * - Aim for shorter, clearer, maintainable form.
     * - Elegance is built by iteration, not first drafts.
     */

    /* Summary:
     *    - Understand → Write simple → Find patterns → Refactor → Improve
     *    - Cleaner, smaller, expressive code is the goal — not just shorter code
     *    - Think like a designer, not a typist
