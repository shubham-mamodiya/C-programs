# C-programs

## In this repo, I have used lcs50 library for some input functions specifically get_string()

### I also implemented my own get_string_unix() function but i am not using it, It only works on Unix based systems and returns pointer

### So, you might need to install it

#### Arch

    yay -S lcs50

##### you don't need to any more I got used to with C style programming

  Here is Github link [lcs50](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50)
